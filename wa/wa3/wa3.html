        <h1> Lightning </h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Lightning is a natural phenomenon formed by electrostatic discharges through the atmosphere between two electrically charged regions, either both in the atmosphere or with one in the atmosphere and on the ground, temporarily neutralizing these in a near-instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy.[1][2][3] This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.</p>

            <h2>Electrification</h2>
        </section>
            <p>The details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. Electrification can be by the triboelectric effect leading to electron or ion transfer between colliding bodies. Uncharged, colliding water-drops can become charged because of charge transfer between them (as aqueous ions) in an electric field as would exist in a thunder cloud.</p>
                <img src="img/pic2.gif" alt= "particles in clouds becoming charged">
            <p>The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from −15 to −25 °C (5 to −13 °F); see Figure 1. In that area, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.</p>  
        
        <section id="Distribution,_frequency_and_extent"> 
            <h2>Distribution, frequency and extent</h2>
        </section>
        <p>Lightning is not distributed evenly around Earth, as shown in the map.</p>
        <p>On Earth, the lightning frequency is approximately 44 (± 5) times per second, or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year and the median duration is 0.52 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 60 to 70 microseconds.</p>   
        <p>Many factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world. These factors include ground elevation, latitude, prevailing wind currents, relative humidity, and proximity to warm and cold bodies of water. To a certain degree, the proportions of intra-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-ground lightning may also vary by season in middle latitudes.</p>   
        <p>Because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though in-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-cloud (CC) are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation. About 70% of lightning occurs over land in the tropics[36] where atmospheric convection is the greatest.</p>
            
        <section id="Flashes_and_Strikes"> 
            <h2>Flashes and Strikes</h2>
        </section>
            <p>The best-studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG) lightning. Although more common, intra-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no "physical" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability of lightning striking the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult even in areas of high CG frequency.</p>
            <h3>Lightning leaders</h3>
            <p>In a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of ionized air, called a "leader", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.[49] In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called "stepping". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.</p>
            <p>It is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.</p>

        <section id="Types"> 
            <h2>Types</h2>
        </section>
        <p>Three primary types of lightning are defined by the "starting" and "ending" points of a flash channel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intra-cloud (IC) or in-cloud lightning occurs within a single thundercloud unit.</li>
                <li> Cloud-to-cloud (CC) or inter-cloud lightning starts and ends between two different "functional" thundercloud units.</li>
                <li>Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>There are variations of each type, such as "positive" versus "negative" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or to different events.</p>

            <h2>Lightning not on Earth</h2>
        </section>
        <p>Lightning, a dazzling and electrifying natural phenomenon, is not confined solely to Earth's skies. Across the vast expanse of the universe, lightning-like discharges of electricity can be found on other celestial bodies, painting a stunning spectacle against alien landscapes. On the gas giant Jupiter, colossal lightning storms rage within its turbulent atmosphere, producing flashes that are hundreds of times more powerful than Earth's lightning bolts. Meanwhile, the frigid and enigmatic moon of<a href= https://teha1355.github.io/wa/wa3.html> Saturn </a>, Enceladus, has been observed emitting icy jets of water vapor and organic molecules into space, akin to the icy lightning of another world. The cosmos, it seems, is not short of its own electrifying displays, offering a captivating glimpse into the electrifying wonders of the universe beyond our planet.</p>
