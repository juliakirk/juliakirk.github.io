    <h1>Change log</h1>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>added language: I added lang="en" inside the html tag to indicate the page language. </li>
        <li>added meta data to head: I added the meta data inside the head which was the two meta tags with charset and name. </li>
        <li>added closing tag for tr for cells 4-6 and closed td for cell 3</li>
        <li>added closing p tag in nested paragraph. </li>
        <li>closed li tag on Item 3 in the unordered list. </li>
        <li>fixed image link to link properly to image.png inside of the img folder. </li>

    <ol>
        <li>fixed bold tag around "new bradford inn" since it was missing end tag.</li>
        <li>Switched places of h2 and b around 'Interior' header since bold has to be the interior tag to work.</li>
        <li>fixed the link for the segmental arch and bay and linked it to the wikipedia page from the original.</li>
        <li>changed h6 to h2 and closed element around history since it is bad practice to jump from h2 to h6 and element needed to be closed.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Added meta information and linked css stylesheet within the header to apply css elements to the file</li>

        <li>Added lang = "en" to the document inside of the html tag</li>
