    <h1>Change Log:</h1>
    <h2>Page 1:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Document was missing a language so I added language: I added lang="en" inside the html tag to indicate the page language. </li>
        <li>Header was missing meta data so I added meta data to head: I added the meta data inside the head which was the two meta tags with charset and name. </li>
        <li>File was missing some closing tags for cells so I added closing tag for tr for cells 4-6 and closed td for cell 3</li>
        <li>The nested paragraph didnt have a closing tage so I added closing p tag in nested paragraph. </li>
        <li>Closing li tag was missing around Item three so I closed the li tag in the unordered list. </li>
        <li>Image link was broken so I fixed image link to link properly to image.png inside of the img folder. </li>
        <li>Table was missing closing tage so I closed the table.</li>
        <li>Added main tags around the main content of the website since it was missing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bold tag around "new bradford inn" since it was missing end tag.</li>
        <li>Switched places of h2 and b around 'Interior' header since bold has to be the interior tag to work.</li>
        <li>Fixed the link for the segmental arch and bay and linked it to the wikipedia page from the original.</li>
        <li>Changed h6 to h2 and closed element around history since it is bad practice to jump from h2 to h6 and element needed to be closed.</li>
        <li>Changed h3 to h2 around discription to make coheseive with the rest of the titles of the same level.</li>
        <li>Added hr tags under the appropriate headers like on the wikipedia page </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Page 3:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added meta information and linked css stylesheet within the header to apply css elements to the file</li>
        <li>Deleted footer position in cars.css so it would not cover text and would appropretly be placed as a footer </li>
        <li>Added !DOCTYPE html to the top of the page since it was missing</li>
        <li>Added lang = "en" to the document inside of the html tag since it was missing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Page 4:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added DOCTYPE html </li>
        <li>Added td tags on one or both sides to dogSinging.png, OrangeCat.png, and creature.png.</li>
        <li>Moved table titles from their own row to the start of the other rows so they would be aligned with the correct images for the category title.</li>
